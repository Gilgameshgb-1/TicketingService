        <h3>How to Sell Tickets</h3>
        <p>
          To sell tickets through our site, you must first create an account and
          have it verified by us. Once your account is active, you can create
          listings for events you want to sell tickets to. To create a listing,
          you will need to provide some basic information about the event, such
          as its location, date and time, type, ticket prices, and number of
          tickets available. When a ticket is purchased, our system will
          automatically generate a QR code that will be scanned at the event.
          You will receive payment for the tickets sold within 2-3 business days
          after the event.
